Description: This package implements a method to build logic-based models of signalling networks 
	based on mass spectrometry phosphoproteomics data and kinase/phosphatase-substrate relationships. 
	The method was described in this publication: Large-scale models of signal propagation in human cells 
	derived from discovery phosphoproteomic data, Terfve et al., Nature Communications, 2015.
