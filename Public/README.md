# ILP Functions

This folder contains the R scripts which calls and implements the objective function, constraints and bounds of the ILP formulation of PHONEMeS for two steps: score optimization and model size reduction. 

This folder also contains the commands which are called by the CPLEX executable file for both optimization steps and which also need to be saved in the working directory.
